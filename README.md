GREEDY! is a two-player wagering game. If your wager is greater than your opponent's wager, you win the round... unless you wager more than 4X your opponent's wager, in which case you lose the maount you wagered. You both begin with 200 units. You win the game once you have 381 or more units at the end of any round. Conversely, you lose if you go below 20 units at the end of any round. You've got to lock in your wager before the time runs out or you will lost the amount that your opponent has wagered. If both players timeout in three conecutive rounds, the game ends and the player in the lead wins the game.
